# Graphs_And_Networks
I plan to include a few graph algorithms like Floyd-Warshall Shortest Path, Kruskal, Prim's, etc. 

Example:

1) Input Adjacency Matrix of a directed graph having 4 vertices:
0 1 1 1 ;
0 0 0 1 ;
1 1 0 1 ;
1 0 0 0 

Output Graph:
![4 Vertex Graph](https://github.com/chiragragarwal/Graphs_And_Networks/4_vertex_graph.png)

2) Input Adjacency Matrix of a directed graph having 8 vertices:
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ;
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ;
0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ;
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ;
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ;
1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ;
1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ;
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Output Graph:
![8 Vertex Graph](https://github.com/chiragragarwal/Graphs_And_Networks/8_vertex_graph.png)
